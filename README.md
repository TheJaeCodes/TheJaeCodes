# Hey there, I'm Jae 👋

Welcome to my corner of the internet—I'm a passionate learner on a mission to turn curiosity into code and creativity into real-world solutions. Currently working full-time in software support while leveling up my skills in web development one project, bug, and breakthrough at a time.

## 💻 What I'm Working On

- 🎯 Earning certifications through [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
- 💡 Building a foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React
- 🛠️ Creating real-world projects to showcase on GitHub
- 📝 Documenting my journey, mistakes, and milestones like a boss

## 📚 My Current Tech Stack

- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (in progress)
- Git & GitHub
- Markdown (because documentation matters!)

## 🌱 What I'm Learning Next

- Responsive Web Design best practices
- JavaScript algorithms & data structures
- Version control workflows with Git
- Front-end libraries like React

## 🎯 My Goals

- Build a full portfolio site from scratch
- Land freelance or remote dev opportunities in 2026
- Combine my love of writing and tech into custom tools for authors & storytellers
- Inspire other women who are rebuilding their lives to take up space in tech

## 🖤 A Little About Me

- 📍 Based in the U.S. and always planning my next road trip
- ✍️ Aspiring author with a love for intense romance, poetic contradictions, and morally gray characters
- ☕ Runs on coffee, playlists, and impossible dreams
- 💬 Motto: *"This isn’t just about code. It’s about taking back control, line by line, until this life looks like mine."*

> **Fun Fact:** I'm teaching myself to code while working full-time, writing a novel, lifting weights, and chasing a dream that once felt too big. Turns out... I was just the right size all along. 😉
